A small wrist-watch sized disc which has a glowing blue rim and centre, which upon recieving a certain signal that is sent from the user's 
brain, will immediately emit a large blue grid that will block and burn any substance that touch it.  
(This may pose a threat to MPF, so we might need to give the Units that use this a special burn-proof uniform to protect them.) This could be used 

<:: Notes 1

It seems that a biogates features include a button on either side of the device, when either is touched a forcefield is produced, to create a
spherical shield we may have to have a pointed biogate on each edge, but the question is how may this be portable? Will we have to build a
strong enough projection to block basic attacks, this may take up lots of power, a renewable or infinite small powersource is something
that may be developed before this project is continued. It seems that the biogate generates it's own power, I will continue to study this
in more depth now.

The biogate seems to have an indefinte height and length, possibly this combine tech is created with a strong enough projection to block
certain signals. Supposedly you must have a Union card, or a NEXUS attached biosignal. I supposed every UNION card has a strong enough
biosignal to enter a biogate, so this tech will most likely be unable to be used by a rebel, unless they are a unit. It seems that the
lights on the side of the biogates metal structure possibly have a powersource inside them, unless there is a powersource that is replaced
later, or in months, if so this powersource may be able to power these shields for months! I doubt this though because a bendable biogate
must take a certain amount of power, so we may be starting with a biogrenade, forming a small enough shield with enough power in that small
shield to run for multiple minutes. The powersource may be mounted in a powerblock on the units back, possibly forming a new type of units,
possibly a HEAVY division.
